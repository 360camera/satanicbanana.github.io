// wandcrafting mechanics similar to noita, but played on a turn based top-down grid like rift wizard
// ascii based, of course :)  kind of like dwarf fortress graphics
// spells can be:
// - cores (typical spells) with their own specific stat bases
//   - for example; Fireball => 10 range, 2 radius, 10 fire damage, 5 mana cost
// - modifiers (applied exactly the same as in noita, including multicasts)
//   - stat changes (e.g. +1 radius). usually combined with some kind of associated mana cost
//
//   - damage type changes - might fall under the umbrella of "all X damage from this spell is now Y damage".
//     can also be "half X damage is redealt as Y damage", "+5 X damage" or "+10 damage to direct spell targets"
//     when damage types are not given (e.g. "+5 damage") they will add to the base stat - otherwise they are applied separately (but still trigger other effects here)
//     assumption is that +damage applies to both direct target and aoe.
//     the particle of the spell is based on the damage type usually, except when considering:
//
//   - cosmetic changes (change particle effect, usually)
//
//   - add triggers; make the spell trigger another spell with X conditions, e.g. "cast new spell at self" or "cast new spell at target" or
//     "cast new spell X times in random locations in a circle of radius" or "cast new spell one turn later" etc
//     some spells have inbuilt triggers
//
//   - shape changes; change the spell's effect shape.
//     square, circle, ring, diamond, square border, etc
//     usually comes with a bonus or drawback depending on how good the spell is (e.g. square -3 radius or ring -5 manacost)
//     assume the "base" shape is a circle (cover less = bonus, cover more = drawback)
//     shapes usually overwrite each other but the effects don't (wink wink)
//
//   - multicasts; identical to noita, modifiers are shared but paid for only once, spells are cast at once, etcetc
//
//   - misc things, for example:
//     delay (spell appears X turns after being cast)
//     armour (you are not affected by this spell)
//     unprotected (you ARE affected by this spell (this is the normal behaviour of most spells))
//     random core, random modifier (of course)
//     blood magic (subsequent cores and modifiers are paid for using HP instead of MP)
//     shape combination (multicast, but for shapes - means the shape will be the union of the two)
//
// need to find a font which supports emojis - or just use the dwarf fortress font lol
// semi important; spells are kind of rare, especially cores.
// mana notes; gain some mana every turn, increases with levelups? i guess
// levelups let you gain skills which will help with [stuff] like mana regen or max mana etc idk
// dont want to write a skill tree so the bonuses will either be random or fixed every time
// i want the focus to be on the spells, not skills
